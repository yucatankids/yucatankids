            <p class="cs-text">
                Yucatán Kids AC is a registered nonprofit with Donatario status, enabling us to provide tax receipts (facturas) to
                donors. We work at Casa Otoch, a state-run home for orphans and at-risk children in Caucel, Yucatán, where we are the
                official provider of English classes, serving more than 200 students aged 3 to 18.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Through English instruction and educational and cultural activities, we promote the emotional and personal growth of
                orphans and disadvantaged children in Yucatán, equipping them with skills to secure jobs and achieve independence in
                adulthood.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Founded in 2015, our team has grown to include three paid part-time English teachers and more than 30 volunteers from
                around the world, representing Mexico and five other countries.

                As adolescents transition from orphanages and into their future lives, they may have limited education and job skills, which can make it difficult for them to find employment and support themselves financially.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                We provide English learning programs through cultural enrichment that open up a world of educational and career opportunities
                for these children. The support we provide has life-changing and enriching effects for them as they transition into their adulthood.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Children who have access to quality English language education and cultural enrichment may be more
                likely to succeed in school, pursue higher education, and secure good jobs.
