In addition to teaching English, Yucatan Kids AC partners with Casa Otoch, the state-run orphanage, to provide the children with resources and opportunities, helping them transition into independence.

We depend on the generosity of our benefactors and sponsors to continue to provide the highest level of English instruction and to continue our mission for the children of Casa Otoch. To become a sponsor of Yucatan Kids AC, contact us for more information.

Donations are tax deductible. We can provide you with factoras/receipts.
