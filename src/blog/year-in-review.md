We are thrilled to be able to share our year in review with you! It's been an incredible year filled with exciting and positive changes. We can't wait to highlight all the amazing moments and developments that have taken place. Get ready to celebrate with us!

#### **Program Services & Accomplishments**

Yucatán Kids A.C. initiated a pilot program, ‘English Beyond the Classroom’ for our students at Casa Otoch. Our English teachers, Miguel (Mike), Ricardo (Rich), and Jose, with the support of our native speaking volunteers, took English lessons beyond the classroom. The goal of this program is to produce confident young English speakers who are well equipped to use their language skills when they age out of Casa Otoch.

Congratulations to all of our English students that achieved A-1 and A-2 levels on the Cambridge English Language Exam.

Two of Yucatan Kid’s marvelous volunteers, Edgard and Jonathan, held the first of several seminars designed to prepare the children of Casa Otoch to ‘age out.’ Life skills covered include: the importance of English, searching for job opportunities, preparing for interviews, understanding time management, creating personal budgets, and more.

**Three components of English Beyond the Classroom**

1. **Traditional English Classes** are taught by our 3-part time salaried English teachers. Grammar, vocabulary, reading and writing skills are emphasized.
2. **English Conversation Groups** led by nineteen volunteers from Mexico and several other countries. Small groups that focus on speaking and understanding English spoken with a variety of accents. The groups provide a more casual atmosphere to practice English.
3. **Outings** are day trips to places where the children can use English in real world situations. The outings give the older children the opportunity to explore archeological sites, art museums, parks, ballet, and various performances. The younger children visit the zoo, LaPlancha, movies and more.

We would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to our incredible Yucatán Kids family! We appreciate the tremendous contributions of our board of directors, teachers, volunteers, sponsors, and all the individuals who work together to make a positive impact on the lives of underprivileged children at risk. Your support means the world to us!
